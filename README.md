# drop-six-game
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Drop Six is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a vertical line of six of one's own discs.

## Rules of Connect Six
* You will start as player One
* You will take your go as player One
* You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
* Once your go is taken and you did not win, it'll be player Two's go
* The gamer will continue until a winning combination of six is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found
* The first place to do this, wins.
